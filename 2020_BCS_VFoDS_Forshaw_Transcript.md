## Slide One
Hello everyone. It’s a pleasure to join you at the BCS Virtual Festival of Digital Skills. My name is Matt Forshaw and today I’ll be speaking to you about skills in computing and specifically in data science. This talk will draw on my experience working as programme director of data science programmes at Newcastle University, and in my role as National Skills Lead at The Alan Turing Institute, which the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence.

My contact details are available on this slide and I’ll be very happy to discuss these topics further if you are interested. I have also made available a copy of my slides, as well as an accessible transcript, and additional resources at the Github link shown on the slide.


## Slide Two
To set the scene I would like to speak about three key challenges in the data skills space at present. In particular I will focus on those which represent the most significant barriers to progress. 

The first issue concerns terminology and nomenclature. Within academia there are genuine arguments around what constitutes data science and AI, and these have not been resolved satisfactorily by prior efforts at standardisation. We observe a significant increase in the number of University programmes in data science and AI, but with their emphasis differing, their contribution to skills need is difficult to assess-at a glance.
These challenges around terminology perpetuate through the labour market, leading to the inconsistent use of role descriptors, complicating skills assessments and hiring practices.

The second challenge is around lack of alignment between training offerings and the needs of the workforce. It is particularly encouraging to see revitalised discussions around professionalisation of the data science occupation, including many professional bodies in this space including BCS, the Royal Statistical Society, The OR Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering. This will explore the role of accreditation to ensure educational programmes deliver the right skills and knowledge for those looking to enter the profession. 

Finally we must focus on raising awareness and widening access to the variety of routes to academic and vocational training, with a particular emphasis on attracting historically underrepresented groups to the field.

## Slide Three
When I talk about skills in data science and AI I love to start with this Venn diagram. This speaks to the interdisciplinary nature of the field, brining together skills from computing and maths and statistics, as well as subject matter expertise. The centre section here is referred to as “Unicorn” based on this rare, almost mythical blend of skills.

Each year when I welcome students to my data science programme we run an exercise where I encourage everyone to position themselves within this figure based on their previous experience and confidence levels. What this shows is the diversity of background of our students, which is always really exciting, but also the tendency towards imposter syndrome in the field. We have students from computing backgrounds whose last memory of maths and stats was large class sizes back in school. We have students from maths and stats backgrounds who feel daunted by some of the contemporary tooling and software engineering best practices in relation to data science and AI. We have individuals returning to study from careers in industry who are intimidated by the Higher education environment, and new graduates intimated by their commercial experience. Meanwhile I’m somewhere in the middle feeling a healthy dose of imposter syndrome in every direction.

I have since come to see this diagram as a fantastic way to position training offerings in data science and AI. The ideal is to have equal representation across the CS and Maths and Statistics schools in the delivery of training. The reason for this is not that statistics training cannot be taught adequately by those in other areas, rather that we would like to highlight to students the research advances which will impact their professional practice within 5-10 years. You could just about convince me to teach an introductory statistics course, but I would not be able to speak to the research advances in as compelling way as someone working at the frontier in that field.

Where I would like to focus is these areas outside of the core Computing and Statistics, it’s shown here as “subject matter expertise” but other versions of this diagram refer to this as “commercial acumen”.


## Slide Four
Looking at these other areas is particularly important when we consider findings such as Gartner showing that 85% of big data and data science projects fail to move from proof-of-concept to production. This is shown to primarily be for organisational reasons rather than technical ones. These are factors which inhibit the translation of data science and AI developments into practice.

## Slide Five
At Newcastle University we look to address these challenges through training on data-driven innovation training. We deliver this as a 10-day incubator programme in collaboration with the National Innovation Centre for Data. We equip students with commercial awareness around the use of data and AI, where students are immersed in an industry setting, working with stakeholders on real business problems.

Collaborative curriculum co-development with partners naturally requires significant resource and expertise. We are fully committed to ensure our training reaches the greatest number of learners. To this end, our curricular materials are all available open source under a Creative Commons license for adoption with your own learner groups and in other courses, so please get in touch with us if you are interested in finding out more                               .

## Slide Six
Anaconda, in their The State of Data Science 2020 report, surveyed over two thousand people between February and April 2020. They found that only 15% of University graduates in data science believed they had received adequate training on ethics.

It is clear that we must embed ethics throughout the taught curriculum, rather than just in elective modules.

A question I would like for us to debate in the Q&A section of the Virtual Festival is this: how might we support our learners in their professional practice upon graduation? We can impart values and ways-of-thinking to our learners, but how do we equip them to uphold these values in a professional setting where colleagues or their organisation don’t share these values?

## Slide Seven
It’s critical that we consider these cultural issues as a cross-cutting concern in our data science curricula.

In particular we need to develop strong awareness of Algorithmic bias and fairness which risks creating exclusionary experiences and discriminatory practices.

These biases may arise, for example, from lack of diversity in training sets for machine learning models.

Open source libraries and pre-trained models then perpetuate these biases, with very low friction for them to be incorporated into projects which have a very real impact on society.

We need to explicitly check the impact of bias during development and testing, and advocate strongly for diverse teams with different life experiences governing the development and use of these technologies.

## Slide Eight
This diversity is essential to the development of a robust data science skills base, therefore, we need to draw on the country’s entire intellectual capital.

Progression into postgraduate training in data science is as low as 11% for black and 8.4% for disabled students.
The inequitable impact of Covid-19 on women and BAME communities is likely to have slowed progress on diversity and inclusion in all sectors.
When we consider the Office for National Statistics’ estimate that over 70% of 1.5 million roles at risk of automation are held by women, it is clear that urgent intervention is required.

For those interested in this topic I strongly recommend BCS’s report Scaling up the Ethical AI MSc pipeline by Bill Mitchell who is also speaking today.

## Slide Nine
One of the most promising steps in widening participation was that In June 2020, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Office for AI announced £13m to support degree conversion courses in data science and AI. This includes £10m for up to 1,000 scholarships for people from diverse backgrounds, matched by an additional £11m from universities and industry partners. 

At Newcastle University we were one of thirteen universities to receive this funding. We recognise the significant contribution that the ten thousand pound scholarships make to our learners, and look to support our learners through additional mechanisms. We offer pre-sessional training to help applicants develop confidence in the higher education setting, to identify themselves as beneficiaries of these courses, and attract applicants from outside of STEM disciplines. We allocate industry mentors who hold leadership roles in data science — many of whom themselves from historically underrepresented groups, and we guaranteed industry internships at the point of entry for scholarship-holders.

Through this national scheme we will see a total of 2500 learners equipped with data science and AI technical skills as well as the contextual knowledge and experience to apply these to real-world problems.

## Slide Ten
We must develop training which promotes a culture and environment that retains data science talent, including supporting interdisciplinary data science teams.

Democratise and widen access to training which is both responsive and ‘at scale’. This can include on-demand reselling through MOOCs, short courses and open curricula. 

Encourage strong alignment between training providers and industry need to ensure strong alignment.

## Slide Eleven
One area I have been particularly involved in over the last two years has been in establishing the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Data Specialist apprenticeship, at Masters level.

This standard was developed by a trailblazer group led by the BBC and including many of the organisations and Universities shown in the top right of the slide. This apprenticeship started delivery in October, with a further round of delivery in January 2021. For those interested in the fantastic opportunities offered by apprenticeship training, I’ve highlighted two excellent sessions led by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education and a session on apprenticeships’ role in economic recovery and growth.

We must continue to work to meed the needs of industry in skills offerings. There are now calls for further discipline-specific flavours of apprenticeship standards , for example the Science Industry Partnership Skills of 2030 report advocates for apprenticeship standards for the life sciences. We need to work to ensure there is consistency across each of these standards, that they continue to provide valuable routes to upskilling in areas of critical importance, with funding routes available to SMEs.
